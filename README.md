This is the code repository for [Machine Learning for Imbalanced Data](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1801070830), published by Packt.

**Tackle imbalanced datasets using machine learning and deep learning techniques**

## What is this book about?

As machine learning practitioners, we often encounter imbalanced datasets in which one class has considerably fewer instances than the other. Many machine learning algorithms assume an equilibrium between majority and minority classes, leading to suboptimal performance on imbalanced data. This comprehensive guide helps you address this class imbalance to significantly improve model performance.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Use imbalanced data in your machine learning models effectively
* Explore the metrics used when classes are imbalanced
* Understand how and when to apply various sampling methods such as over-sampling and under-sampling
* Apply data-based, algorithm-based, and hybrid approaches to deal with class imbalance
* Combine and choose from various options for data balancing while avoiding common pitfalls
* Understand the concepts of model calibration and threshold adjustment in the context of dealing with imbalanced datasets

```
from collections import Counter
X, y = make_data(sep=2)
print(y.value_counts())
sns.scatterplot(data=X, x="feature_1", y="feature_2")
plt.title('Separation: {}'.format(separation))
plt.show()
```
