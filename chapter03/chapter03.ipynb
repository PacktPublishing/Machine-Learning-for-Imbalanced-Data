    "Imagine a town with two warring communities, viz., Montague and Capulet. They have been enemies of each other for generations. Montague is in the minority, and Capulet is in the majority in the town. Montagues are super rich and powerful. Capulets are not that well off. This creates a complex situation in the town. There are regular riots in the town because of this rivalry. One day, Montague wins the king's favor and conspires to eliminate some Capulets to bring their numbers down. The idea is that if there are fewer Capulets in the town, Montague will no longer be in the minority. King agrees to the plan as he hopes for peace after its execution.

Alternatively, the king can remove Capulates who live near the houses of the Montagues. Lastly, he can remove Capulets, who live far away from the houses of the Montagues. These are the three major approaches used in under-sampling techniques. We either remove the majority samples uniformly, we remove the majority samples near the minority samples, or we remove the majority samples far from the minority samples.
